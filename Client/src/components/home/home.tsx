                            The goal of this Application is to visualize a unknown Dataset into a 3D space with a simple
                            set of rules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rules can be set under the <a href="/configuration">configuration</a> tab, after
                            choosing a file which contains data. You are able to set the keys primary attribute,
                            secondary attribute and information which gets displayed under the secondary attribute.
